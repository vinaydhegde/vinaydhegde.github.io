I have total 15 years of experience in IT industry and as well as in Devops. Yes, you read it right! All 15 years, I have worked in the area of Devop or related area and I am sure I'll continue to work in the same domain for many more years with the same passion and intent.


I am a **Certified Kubernetes Administraor**, **Docker Certified Associate** and an **Associate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect**



I feel, **Devops** is a most abused word in the current Software Industry. Being in this profession for many years, I have seen the transition & evolution in this domain very closely. The term 'Devops' is may be coined only few years back, but it is not something/entriely a new process/technology. As the software industry is getting matured, the technolgy & processes used in product development are also evolved. All the experience and learnings from the past, made us to define new processes/technologies like Devops, Agile methodology & MicroService architecture which are more suited for the modern IT. 




## My Background and Journey in Devops

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Communication in the Year 2006 and joined a startup called 'Rishi Systems' in Bangalore which was mainly in to product developemt and services, also a channel partner of IBM. I got an opportunity to work on some of IBM tools and support customers with training & implemention of those tools. Mainly, I worked on Rational ClearCase & automation scripting using Perl, for Rational Test RealTime product.



In 2007, I joined 'Siemens India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore' as Build & Release engineer. Here I got more exposure on the build and releases *processes* for multiple products (Legacy as well as new product developement). Along with Version Control Management & processes associated with it, I also got an opportunity improve my scripting skill (especially in Perl). I also got exposure to CI/CD during that period only. I started using Jenkins in 2008/2009, that time it was very primitive especially for non Java projects. Back then, it was called as Hudson. 



After working for Siemens about 3.5 years, I joined Philips India Ltd, bangalore in 2011. Here, I got an opportunity to work for multiple Buisiness Units for multiple Projects which were quite diverse in nature in terms of technology and processes. Initially, I worked on TFS (Team Foundation Server, it is now called as Azure Devops) implementaion and customation like defining Work Items workflow, defining commit policies etc. In later part of my carreer with Philips, I worked mainly on setting up CI/CD processes, defining Jenkins Piplelines etc. Also, I worked on a major Devops project called 'Atlantis', where the goal was to restructure the monolothic source code base to independent release modules (like Microservices, but not exactly) and improve the build performance (reduce the system build time). I also worked on couple of the POCs for containerizing some analytic products using Docker and Kubernetes.



After 7 years of stint at Philips, I joined Oracle India Pvt Ltd bangalore, in July 2018. Here we use our own tools stack for CI/CD and build processes, which is well implemented.
CI/CD framework and many other utilities are developed in PHP. We mantain & enhance these utilities. For any new automation requirements, we use Python. For software configuration for all our build servers, I introduced and implemented Ansible. Oracle introduced it's own cloud solution called 'OCI' (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) and mandated all projects and internal infra to migarate to OCI. I was involved in migrating all our build infra and CI/CD process to OCI.
For an internal QA framework/application, I have implemented a server monitoring solution using Prometheus & Grafana.


As part of my continous learning Journey, I attended trainings on Docker & Kubernetes. I have developed few applications to demonstarte the Docker & Kubernetes workflow. I have taken few training sessions internally for other team members. I have also conducted couple of trainings on Docker & kubernetes  for a start up. To make this journey more exciting, I decided to attempt Docker certification and became **Docker Certified Associate** in November 2020.


I had completed **AWS Solution Architect** course from SimpliLearn in 2017. But, I haven't got a chance to attempt for AWS certification. Since, in Oracle we use OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure), thought I should attempt for OCI certification. In April 2021, I got certified as **Associate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect**.

Recentlty (In Jan 2022), I got certified in Kubernetes (**Certified Kubernetes Administrator**).


So to conclude, when I started my carreer as a build & release engineer, many people in the Software Industry did not know what is 'Build & release' all about. Now, everyone knows what is Devops (at least in the brod sense). If an Organization can define, for them, what does Devops mean, who are their devops professionals and what is their scope of work, Company will definitley benifit. I feel, this is where Companies are lacking clarity. But, as we mature in this Journey & gain experience (in adopting Devops process), will get the clarity gradually. I am excited to be part of this journey. After spending these many years in this domain, I have many skills in my kitty. Devops has become so vast with so many tools and technologies to learn. The list is going bigger and bigger. I have learnt and mastered some of those tools & technologies. I am happy & proud to be a **DevOpsian**.
