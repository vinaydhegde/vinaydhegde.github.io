1. **Can I SSH to a container?**  
**Ans:** Yes (if SSH server is running in your container), but it is not recommended.  
Use 'docker exec' or 'docker attach'  
Refer:   
[Your containers should not run an SSH server](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/06/23/docker-ssh-considered-evil/ "Title").  
Here, there is a mention of 'nsenter' tool. But it is not recommended by docker now, since they have introduced 'docker exec' & 'docker attach'

2. **Can I set a hostname for the container?**  
**Ans:** Yes, use --hostname while creating/running the container. i.e. 'docker run --hostname `<hostname>` `<image_name>`'    
  
3.  **Can I assign a static IP to the container?**  
**Ans:** Yes, by creating a new network with subnet IP range & Run 'docker run' with --ip  
Note: 1) On the default bridge network, you cannot assign a static IP 2) When container is not runing (i.e. exited), IP is not assigned  

4. **Can I allocate RAM/memory to a container?**  
**Ans:** You cannot allocate memory, but you can set the memory limit using '--memory' (for ex: docker run --memory="250m" `<image_name>`)    
Note: By default, container will have access to the entire memory of docker host. 

5. **Can I allocate/restrict CPUs to a container?**  
**Ans:** You can allocate specific CPU or specific core of the CPU  
Note: By default, each container’s access to the host machine’s CPU cycles is unlimited  

6. **What are the different states of a container?**    
**Ans:** created, restarting, running, paused, exited, dead  

7. **Do I lose my data when the container exits?**    
**Ans:** No.  
But, when container is removed data will be lost if it is written to writable layer of the container filesystem i.s.o volumes  

8. **Can I remove a paused container from Docker?**  
**Ans:** No  

9. **Where the docker volumes are stored?**  
**Ans:** /var/lib/docker/volumes  

10. **What are the different types of Docker networking driver?**   
**Ans:** Bridge, Host, Overlay, MacVLAN  

11. **With which user container will run? How to add/create users? How to run a container with a different user?**  
**Ans:** Use '--user' (i.e. docker run --user `<user>` `<image_name>`) or add an instruction in the Dockerfile as 'USER `<user>`'  
By default, container will run as 'root'  
Note: Docker daemon will always run from 'root' user. We cannot change this.    

12. **How to find the size of containers, volumes & images?**  
**Ans:** Docker system df -v 

13. **What is the storage capacity of Docker & the conatiners?**  
**Ans:** It depends on the storage driver.  

14. **Why it is recommended to run only one process in a container?**  
**Ans:** 1) Scaling containers horizontally is much easier if the container is isolated to a single function
2) Easy to re-use for other purpose or projects 3) Portable 4) Predictable

15. **Can I specify multiple ENTRYPOINT in the dockerfile?**
**Ans:** Yes, you can. But it will take only one. i.e. the last one you defined

16. **How to check the ENTRYPOINT & CMD of a given docker image?**
**Ans:** docker image inspect <imageid>
  
17. **What is the default log driver for containers**
**Ans:** json-file

18. **Run a container with 'syslog' log driver**
**Ans:** Docker run --log-driver syslog <image>
  
20. **How to see the container logs**
**Ans:** docker logs

21. **How to get the size/diskspace of running containers**
**Ans:** Docker ps -s <container_name>

22. **Which is the default storage driver & how to check what storage driver is in use?**
**Ans:** 
docker info

23. **What is the path of dockerd config file**
**Ans:** /etc/docker/daemon.json
