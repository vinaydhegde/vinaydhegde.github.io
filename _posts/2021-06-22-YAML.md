### Overview

YAML is a serialization language

#### What is serialization language?
Application written in different technology/different languages etc which have diff data structure can transfer data between each other using common agreed on or standard format.
Most popular such formats are YAML, JSON & XML

#### YAML - YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language

YAML poplularity has increased in the past few years because, it is super human readable & intuitive. 
This makes YAML a great fit for writing configuration files for all those recent deveops tools like docker, kubernetes etc.

File extension: .yaml or .yml

Let's consider a data structure and see how it is written in YAML, JSON & XML

As you see above, `XML` & `JSON` datastrucure are defined using special characters. Where as in `YAML`, there is no special characters.

`XML` - texts with angular brackets

`JSON` - texts with curly brackets

`JSON` - Data structure are handled through `line separation` & `indentation`

In YAML, you will get validation error if indentation is wrong, which may be little bit annoying but it makes yaml format the cleanest most human readable format of all three.

YAML is used in Docker compose file, Ansible, Prometheus, Kubernetes and many more tools.

### YAML Syntax

#### Data types
There are 3 data types:
1. Scalar
2. List
3. Object or Dictionary

**Scalar**:
In YAML, scalar means a simple value for a key. The value of the scalar can be `integer`, `float`, `Boolean` and `string`. 
`<key>: <value>`

Scalar data types are classified into two data types: 1. Numeric data type 2. String
*Numeric Data type* - Here, values can be Integer or float or boolean. Values are NOT enclosed in quotes.
Boolean values can be: yes/no, true/false, on/off
For example: 
`age: 65`
`rating: 4.5`
`light: on`
`started: yes`
`open: true`
b. *String* - Unicode strings optionally enclosed by quotes (i.e. Quotes are optional. if you have any specal character like \n, then you need to enclose it in double quotes).


**List**
Elements in a list are created using `-`. For example:
