### Overview

YAML is a serialization language

#### What is serialization language?
Application written in different technology/different languages etc which have diff data structure can transfer data between each other using common agreed on or standard format.
Most popular such formats are YAML, JSON & XML

#### YAML - YAML Ain’t Markup Language

YAML poplularity has increased in the past few years because, it is super human readable & intuitive. 
This makes YAML a great fit for writing configuration files for all those recent deveops tools like docker, kubernetes etc.

File extension: .yaml or .yml

Let's consider a data structure and see how it is written in YAML, JSON & XML

As you see above, `XML` & `JSON` datastrucure are defined using special characters. Where as in `YAML`, there is no special characters.

`XML` - texts with angular brackets

`JSON` - texts with curly brackets

`JSON` - Data structure are handled through `line separation` & `indentation`

In YAML, you will get validation error if indentation is wrong, which may be little bit annoying but it makes yaml format the cleanest most human readable format of all three.

YAML is used in Docker compose file, Ansible, Prometheus, Kubernetes and many more tools.

### YAML Syntax

#### Data types
There are 3 data types:
1. Scalar
2. List
3. Object or Dictionary

**Scalar**:

In YAML, scalar means a simple value for a key. The value of the scalar can be `integer`, `float`, `Boolean` and `string`. 

`<key>: <value>`

Scalar data types are classified into two data types: 1. Numeric data type 2. String

*Numeric Data type* - Here, values can be Integer or float or boolean. Values are NOT enclosed in quotes.

Boolean values can be: yes/no, true/false, on/off

For example:

`age: 65`

`rating: 4.5`

`light: on`

`started: yes`

`enabled: true`

b. *String* - Unicode strings optionally enclosed by quotes (i.e. Quotes are optional. if you have any specal character like \n, then you need to enclose it in double quotes).


**List**

Elements in a list are created using `-`. For example:

List with just values:

```
colurs:
  - red
  - yellow
  - blue
``` 

```
price:
  - sixty
  - seventy
  - 50
```  

List with attributes (key: values):

```
languages:
  - python: backend
  - javascript: frontend
```

Note: items in the list can be written without indentation also.


We can define the list in a single line as well. For example:

price: [sixty, 50, "seventy"]

**Object OR Dictinory**

We can group the key value files in an object. syntax is,

```
<object_name>:
     <Key>: <value>
     <Key>: <value>
```

For example:

```
Skills: 
  cicd: jenkins
  container_orch: kubernets
  containerisation: docker
  data_serialisation: yaml
```

Please note, space has to be exactly same for each attribute. YAML doesn’t support TABs.

YAML is senstive about spaces & indentation. We can use online Yaml validator to validate the syntax.

**Comments**

Comments in YAML starts with #

For example:

`# This is a comment`

**Multiline String**

Multiline strings are written using `|`

For example:

```
profile: |
I am a devops engineer.
I work for XYZ company.
```

**Single line string** written in multiline using `>`

For example:

```
profile: >
I am a devops engineer,
working for XYZ company.
```

It will be displayed as, `I am a devops engineer, working for XYZ company.`

**Environemnt variables**

`{{ variable_name }}`

**Multiple YAML components in a single file**

Multiple components in a single YAML file is written using 3 dashes —--


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    VolumeMounts:
      - name: nginx-VolumeMounts
        mountPath: /usr/nginx/html
  - name: sidecar-container
    image: curlimages/curlimages
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "echo Hello from the sidecar container; sleep 300"]
```
