### Overview

YAML is a serialization language

#### What is serialization language?
Application written in different technology/different languages etc which have diff data structure can transfer data between each other using common agreed on or standard format.
Most popular such formats are YAML, JSON & XML

#### YAML - YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language

YAML poplularity has increased in the past few years because, it is super human readable & intuitive. 
This makes YAML a great fit for writing configuration files for all those recent deveops tools like docker, kubernetes etc.

File extension: .yaml or .yml

**XML** & **JSON** datastrucure are defined using special characters.

**XML** - texts with angular brackets

**JSON** - texts with curly brackets

Where as in **YAML**, there is no special characters. Data structure are handled through `line separation` & `indentation`

In YAML, you will get validation error if indentation is wrong, which may be little bit annoying but it makes yaml format the cleanest most human readable format of all three.

YAML is used in Docker compose file, Ansible, Prometheus, Kubernetes and many more tools.
